  <h1>Understanding HTML</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML acts like building blocks for the internet. These blocks have tags, like special badges called attributes.</li>
    <li>Attributes give extra information and are always introduced at the beginning of the tag.</li>
    <li>Imagine a <a href="#link" title="Link Explanation">link</a> on a webpage. The <code>href</code> attribute in the link's tag is like a magical address book, guiding the computer to the linked page.</li>
    <li>Pictures on a webpage, known as images, have a <a href="#src" title="Src Attribute Explanation">src</a> attribute that's like a treasure map showing where the picture is hidden.</li>
    <li>The <a href="#width-height" title="Width and Height Attributes Explanation">width and height</a> attributes of a picture indicate its size, and the <a href="#alt" title="Alt Attribute Explanation">alt</a> attribute is like a short description in case the picture can't be seen.</li>
    <li>Let's talk about style â€“ the look and feel of a webpage. The <a href="#style" title="Style Attribute Explanation">style</a> attribute is like a box of crayons, allowing you to choose colors, fonts, and sizes to make things visually appealing.</li>
    <li>Remember the <a href="#lang" title="Lang Attribute Explanation">lang</a> attribute? It's like saying, "Hey, computer, this webpage speaks a particular language!"</li>
    <li>The <a href="#lang" title="Lang Attribute Explanation">lang</a> attribute specifies the language of the whole webpage. Finally, the <a href="#title" title="Title Attribute Explanation">title</a> attribute gives a bit more info about something on the webpage.</li>
    <li>Think of a website as a storybook. The big titles at the beginning of a section are like chapter names - they're called headings.</li>
    <li>Headings have different levels, like Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. In website language, we use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the main heading and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for smaller ones.</li>
    <li>The regular text on a website, like paragraphs, is created using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. It helps to keep things neat and organized, just like paragraphs in a book. So, headings are like big chapter titles, and paragraphs are like the regular text in a story. Easy, right?</li>
  </ul>
