        <h1>RECYCLING PLASTICS INTO JEWELLERY</h1>
        <p> Plastic bags are a major environmental concern as they contribute to pollution and take a long time to decompose.<br>
            Recycling them into jewelry helps reduce the overall amount of plastic waste in landfills and oceans.</p>

         <p>By repurposing plastic bags into fashionable accessories, we minimize the need for new raw materials, such as metals
             or gemstones,<br> thereby conserving natural resources.</p>
        <p>Below is a picture of bracelets that I made out of plastic bags.</p><br>
